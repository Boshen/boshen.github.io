# Getting Started with My Blog

Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Web development
- JavaScript tips and tricks
- Design patterns
- Open source projects

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Links and Formatting

You can also use **bold text**, *italic text*, and [links](https://github.com).

Thanks for reading!
