I started [Oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) as a learning project for compilers, performance engineering and open source. It grew into something I never imagined it could become. Today it is downloaded millions of times every week, and real teams, companies and people depend on it.

If you visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Boshen), you will see that I have not missed a single day of contributions since October 2023, and I began working on [Oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) continuously from January. Building tools for the ecosystem brings incredible highs, but the lows can be heavy, and at times they pull me into depression.

For a long time I believed that being an open source maintainer meant resolving every issue, reviewing every pull request and answering every question. Holding myself to that standard became a silent burden, and very few people truly understand what this level of commitment feels like, not even my wife.

Through all of this I am grateful for my mentor [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) and for the shared vision we are building at [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev). We want to create a sustainable model for open source and use it to give back to the community in a meaningful way.

Every few months we hear about another important open source maintainer burning out and quietly stepping away. I collected the stories below to show gratitude for their work and also as a reminder to myself of how easily burnout can happen and how important it is to avoid repeating the same path.

If my work has improved your development experience, your CI pipelines, your build times or your learning in any way, please consider sponsoring. It helps more than you might think and it truly keeps the motivation alive.
